## 🎯 Learning Path

### Week 1: Data Structures
Built the building blocks (Stack, Queue, Hash Map, Linked List, Tree, Graph)

### Week 2: Core Algorithms
Implemented fundamental algorithms (Binary Search, Two Pointers, Merge Sort, Dijkstra's, DP)

### Week 3: Real-World Applications
Created production tools (Git Diff, Autocomplete, GPS, Calculator, Compressor, Load Balancer)

### Week 4: LeetCode Patterns ← You Are Here!
Master interview patterns that unlock hundreds of problems

## 💡 Why Patterns Matter

Instead of memorizing 1000 problems, learn 6 patterns:
- ✅ **Recognition**: See a problem → Know the pattern
- ✅ **Application**: Apply pattern → Solve similar problems
- ✅ **Interview Ready**: Most FAANG questions use these patterns
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Solve 300+ problems with 6 techniques

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Visualization**: Canvas API, CSS Animations
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Philosophy**: No frameworks, pure understanding

---

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Watch**: See the algorithm animate step-by-step
2. **Interact**: Try custom inputs and test cases
3. **Learn**: Understand when to apply each pattern
4. **Practice**: Solve linked LeetCode problems
5. **Master**: Recognize patterns in new problems

---

## 🎨 Project Features

Every project includes:
- ✅ Interactive visualization (animated)
- ✅ Multiple problem examples (3-4 per pattern)
- ✅ Speed control (slow/normal/fast/instant)
- ✅ Custom input (test your own cases)
- ✅ Code walkthrough (see algorithm execute)
- ✅ Time/Space complexity analysis
- ✅ Pattern recognition guide
- ✅ LeetCode problem links
